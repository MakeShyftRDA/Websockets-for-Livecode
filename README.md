METHODOLOGY:
************

Made project "Websockets for Livecode"
Uploaded to Knowledge base 2 documents:
1. RFC standard document - The official specifications
2. httpd livecode library - As examples of proper livecode syntax when working with sockets

Question 1: What handlers do we need to fully implement this?

Question 2: Please double check and finalize your list

Question 3: Write as comments, the logical steps needed within each step of each handler

Queston 4: Double check and finalize your logic

Uploaded to Knowledge base

From then on I worked on each handler 1 by 1. After a few handlers i would update the knowledge base with the existing code.

I did not test the code when it was generated, except to make sure it compiled.
I figure testing it can happen when its all there to be tested.
Thanks to everyone who helps out in testing this code.
